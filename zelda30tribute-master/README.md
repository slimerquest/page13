The Zelda 30 Year Tribute project launched in April 2015. It got a bunch of press coverage and saw half a million unique visitors in 3 days. Nintendo shut the site down with a DMCA complaint (no action was taken against the authors, GitHub, or other hosting websites). So we took it down and open sourced it here. Enjoy!
